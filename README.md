# Bike-Sharing_Linear-Regression-Assignment
To build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. 
Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. 
This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
